abstract="We present a technique for deriving predictions for the run times of parallel applications from the run times of ``similar'' applications that have executed in the past. The novel aspect of our work is the use of search techniques to determine those application characteristics that yield the best definition of similarity for the purpose of making predictions. We use four workloads recorded from parallel computers at Argonne National Laboratory, the Cornell Theory Center, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. We show that on these workloads our techniques achieve predictions that are between 14 and 60 percent better than those achieved by other researchers; our approach achieves mean prediction errors that are between 40 and 59 percent of mean application run times.",

abstract="On many computers, a request to run a job is not serviced immediately but instead is placed in a queue and serviced only when resources are released by preceding jobs. In this paper, we build on runtime prediction techniques that we developed in previous research to explore two problems. The first problem is to predict how long applications will wait in a queue until they receive resources. We develop runtime estimates that result in more accurate wait-time predictions than other run-time prediction techniques. The second problem we investigate is improving scheduling performance. We use run-time predictions to improve the performance of the least-work-first and backfill scheduling algorithms. We end that using our run-time predictor results in lower mean wait times for the workloads with higher offered loads and for the backfill scheduling algorithm.",
